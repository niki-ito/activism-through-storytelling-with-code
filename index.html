        <h2>about Me, You, & Us</h2>
        <p>Listen to conversations between people from the Japanese diaspora in the United States to learn about Me (the
          speakers: HATSUE, Niki, and Joe), You (the listener/viewer), and Us (the Japanese diaspora in the United
          States).</p>
        <p>In response to the recent rise in discrimination towards the Asian American community, I searched inwardly
          and outwardly to find personally authentic ways in which I can support and advocate against these
          misunderstandings. Rather than telling you what actions should be made, I found that there is more truth and
          understanding to be cultivated from simply listening, learning, and sharing various narratives of people
          within the community.</p>
        <p>This project aims to highlight narratives that are intimate and less represented in mainstream media. Through
          this audio-focused narrative, listen and learn about the individuals without visual assumptions/projections to
          discover differences and similarities on a more personal level. Cultivate further understanding and compassion
          for individuals and the collective Japanese diaspora in the United States to start thinking about your role
          within our collective future.</p>
